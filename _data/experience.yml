    Responsible for developing in-house recommendation algorithms and ensured they delivered good results in production. 
    Achievements:

    <ul class="resume-item-list">
    <li>Productionised a previously tested model on GCP, using AI Platform for training and serving</li>
    <li>Drove implementation of a solution for more granular analysis of A/B tests using Airflow and Bigquery</li>
    <li>Organised a regular journal club session, where we discussed recent publications and used them to inform our product roadmap</li>
    </ul>

- position: Data Scientist
  duration: Apr 2018 &mdash; Aug 2020
  summary: >
    Worked on a variety of different projects as one of the first members of a new Data Science team,
    and gained exposure to a number of different business areas and modelling techniques, including:

    <ul class="resume-item-list">
    <li>Product demand forecasting</li>
    <li>Online order forecasting</li>
    <li>Supply chain optimisation using vehicle routing models</li>

    </ul>

- company: Kubrick Group
  position: Data Scientist
  duration: Jan 2018 &mdash; Apr 2018
  summary: >
    Kubrick provided 4 months of core training in data problem solving along with 
    the key technologies needed to succeed as a data scientist:

    <ul class="resume-item-list">
    <li>Core Python - data structures, IO, OOP paradigms</li>
    <li>Python libraries for data science & machine learning - sklearn, pandas, numpy</li>
    <li>Advanced SQL</li>
    <li>Git</li>
    </ul>

    This training culminated in a group project, in which my contribution was to use the Twitter API
    to perform an analysis of public perception of different brands based on exemplar accounts.   
    This methodology was adapted from - Culotta, A. and Cutler, J., 2016. Mining brand perceptions from twitter social networks
